# Project_DandleStone - *under development*

This repository contains our first game, a 2D platformer. It is developed with Java FXGL 0.4.1 library and Tiled Map Editor, inspired by [AlmasB.](http://www.github.com/AlmasB/)
It's a battlemap 1 vs 1. The game is still under development, where we intend to implement health, damage and weapons to each player so 
that they can fight each other.
## Instructions
Player one controls: W, A, S, D.

Player two controls: Arrowkeys UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
